### Intro  
I use flux on my PCBs when soldering SMD components; except I ran out suddenly and didn't know of a clean way to transfer the flux in the jar to my syringe.  

Luckily, others have trod the path before me and I now have a near-perfect way of doing this.  


## PRODUCT INFORMATION

### 5 Litres of IPA IsoPropyl Alcohol for flux removal from PCBs
